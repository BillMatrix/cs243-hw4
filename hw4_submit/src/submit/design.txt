We first perform constant propagation and replace register operands with constant ones when applicable.
We then perform dead code elimination.
Finally, we perform an optimized version of redundant NullCheck elimination, which takes into account the fact that when used variables are all nul-checked, the defined variables do not need to be null-checked.
